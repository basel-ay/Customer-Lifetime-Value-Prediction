## What is Customer Lifetime value?
In marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV) is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. Customer lifetime value is a powerful piece of business intelligence that informs an efficient strategy for business growth.

## Why is Customer Lifetime Value Important?
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) helps you allocate your customer procurement budget based on what the new client will actually bring to your firm.

* CLV data helps build more accurate and detailed customer personas.

* To Learn the effect of certain high-level decisions on the value of customer assets. The CLV data can be used to encourage a company culture emphasizing long-term customer satisfaction, rather than solely focusing on short-term sales.

* You can calculate the profitability of a single customer.

## How machine learning helps?
Because of the importance of CLV, it is essential to know the future value of customers by looking at their historical transactions and hence look at the revenue of the organization as a whole. Machine Learning helps in bridging this gap by learning from historical data and predicting the following:

* The persona and the approximate Customer Lifetime Value of a new customer.

* Predicting the next transaction amounts and periodicity for existing customers, hence giving an indication of their adjusted CLV.
